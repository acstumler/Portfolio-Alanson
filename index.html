          <p>I’m an entrepreneur and finance professional based in Louisville, Kentucky. I founded <strong>LumiLedger</strong> to make financial management obvious for small-business owners — turning raw data into clean, actionable insights.</p>
          <p>With 7+ years in accounting and advisory, including more than 4,000 peak-season hours, my work spans financial reporting, forecasting, and tax planning. I operate at the intersection of finance and software: clear logic, clean UX, and outputs you can export and use.</p>

          <h3>In my words</h3>
          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Why entrepreneurship?</h4>
            <p>I grew up around builders. My grandfather co-founded a company, and my dad and grandfather bought, ran, and sold businesses. That environment made entrepreneurship feel less like a choice and more like something I’m meant to do.</p>

            <h4>What made you jump?</h4>
            <p>The LumiLedger idea rolled around for years while I was in financial advising. I reached a crossroads in my career and decided it was time to bring the concept to life.</p>

            <h4>Early-days advice</h4>
            <p>Define the problem and remind yourself of it daily. Don’t try to be everything to everyone. Keep moving in a direction. Have conversations, ask questions, build, learn — and ask for help.</p>

            <h4>Who should start?</h4>
            <p>Anyone with a real problem to solve and the willingness to surround themselves with people whose skills complement their own. Be sure of yourself. Believe in your ability first.</p>
