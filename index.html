      <div class="card glass about-card">
        <p>I’m an entrepreneur and finance professional based in Louisville, Kentucky, focused on transforming how small businesses understand their financial data. After more than seven years in accounting and advisory roles — including over 4,000 hours of tax season work — I saw how much time, clarity, and money business owners lose to manual reporting and disjointed systems. That realization led me to create LumiLedger, a financial software platform that automates data ingestion, classification, and reporting with precision, simplicity, and security. </p>
        <p>I grew up in an entrepreneurial family and have always been drawn to building things that make complexity feel simple. My background blends financial expertise with product design thinking — bridging logic, structure, and usability to make powerful tools feel effortless.</p>
        <p>When I’m not working on LumiLedger, I enjoy exploring new ideas in software, business architecture, and product storytelling — finding ways to connect strong systems with clean, intuitive experiences.</p>
