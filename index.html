      <div class="card glass about-card">
        <p>I’m an entrepreneur and finance professional based in Louisville, Kentucky, focused on transforming how small businesses understand their financial data. After more than seven years in accounting and advisory roles — including over 4,000 hours of tax season work — I saw how much time, clarity, and money business owners lose to manual reporting and disjointed systems. That realization led me to create LumiLedger, a financial software platform that automates data ingestion, classification, and reporting with precision, simplicity, and security.</p>
        <p>I grew up in an entrepreneurial family and have always been drawn to building things that make complexity feel simple. My background blends financial expertise with product design thinking — bridging logic, structure, and usability to make powerful tools feel effortless.</p>
        <p>When I’m not working on LumiLedger, I enjoy exploring new ideas in software, business architecture, and product storytelling — finding ways to connect strong systems with clean, intuitive experiences.</p>

          <div class="xp-body">
            <p>Before starting LumiLedger, I spent several years at ARGI Financial Group, which later merged with Cerity Partners. That period shaped how I see finance — not just as numbers on a page, but as a living part of how a business operates and makes decisions. Working with hundreds of clients across industries, I learned how to turn complexity into clarity and how to explain financial strategy in a way that helped owners make confident, informed moves.</p>

                <p>In my early years at the firm, I focused on helping businesses and individuals build structure and foresight into their financial lives. I worked hands-on with owners to integrate tax planning into everyday decision-making, simplifying what often felt intimidating or opaque. I also helped refine internal processes, building repeatable systems that made reporting, forecasting, and planning more efficient for both the firm and its clients.</p>

                <h4>Retirement Plan Advisor • Aug 2024 — Feb 2025</h4>
                <p>As the firm evolved, I transitioned into retirement plan consulting — guiding employers and plan sponsors through fiduciary responsibilities and helping them strengthen both compliance and participation. I led education sessions for business owners and employees, translating market and fund strategies into language that made long-term financial health easier to understand.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Those years at ARGI and Cerity taught me the importance of communication and design thinking in finance — lessons that became the foundation for how I approach every decision and design inside LumiLedger today.</p>
